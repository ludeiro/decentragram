# Decentragram

## ```Decentralized Social Media```

This app is based on famous photo-sharing applications. But I introduce some changes: 
- You donÂ´t need to create an account, you need an Ethereum Wallet.
- The images are uploaded using [IPFS](ipfs.io): A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
- You can tip the authors with cryptocurrency, in this case, Ethereum
